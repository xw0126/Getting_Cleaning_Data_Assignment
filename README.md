# Getting_Cleaning_Data_Assignment
Final assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course on Coursera 

The function of the run_analysis.R file is to produce two datasets: first, a formatted data frame with combined training and test data from the original dataset, retaining only the mean and standard deviation variables; and second, a summary of mean for each variable from the first dataset per activity type per subject. Both original and output dataset should be stored in "../data/" directory under the working directory. The first dataset will be saved as "UCIHARclean.csv" and the second dataset will be save as "UCIHARmean.csv", both under the same directory. 

More details ahout the variables can be found either in the feature_info.txt file within the original dataset, or from the link below: 

A description of the original data can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
